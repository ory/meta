# meta

A place for reusable code, templates, and documentation required for getting a repository in Ory working.

## Documentation

### Updating Templates

This repository contains templates for things like the software license, security policy, contributing guidelines, code of
conduct, and so on.

You can find the repository templates in [templates/repository](./templates/repository). Libraries (e.g. Dockertest) and servers
(e.g. Kratos) share templates from the [common](./templates/repository/common) directory. Additionally, servers copy files from
[server](./templates/repository/server) and libraries from the [library](./templates/repository/library) directory.

To update the repositories simply make your changes. Once merged to master, they will be published using a GitHub Action.

## Github Sync action

The [meta scripts](https://github.com/ory/meta/tree/master/scripts) serve to synchronize all Ory repositories to a common
template, including README, CONTRIBUTING, COC, SECURITY, LICENCE and Github Workflows with close to zero manual interaction.  
Depending on repository type (server, library, action) specific templates can be copied as well.  
The project names, links to documentation ect. are being substituted for each project in
[sync.sh](https://github.com/ory/meta/blob/master/scripts/sync.sh).  
For more details please refer to the documentation within the [scripts](https://github.com/ory/meta/tree/master/scripts). For more
details on the workflow please refer to the documentation within
[sync.yml](https://github.com/ory/meta/blob/master/.github/workflows/sync.yml)
