Live long and prosper!

The ORY team and the fabulous ORY Community is proud to present the next ORY
Kratos iteration!

ORY Kratos is now capable of handling native iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS
login, registration, settings, recovery, and verification flows. And there is a
reference React Native application that you can find on
[GitHub](http://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native).

We co-released our reference React Native application which acts as a reference
on implementing these flows:

In total, almost 1200 files were changed in about 480 commits. WOW! While you
can find a list of all changes in the changelist below, the following are the
features we are proud of:

- We renamed login, registration, ... requests to "flows" consistently across
  the code base, APIs, and data storage:

  - Initiate a login, registration, ... flow;
  - Fetch a login, registration, ... flow; and
  - Complete a login, registration, ... flow using a login flow method such as
    "Log in with username and password".

- All self-service flows are now capable of handling API-based requests that do
  not originate from browsers such as Chrome. This is set groundwork for
  handling native flows named above!

- The self service documentation has been refactored and simplified. We added
  code samples, screenshots, payloads, and curl commands to make things easier
  and clearer to understand. There are new video guides to help the community
  get things done faster! Just slam that like button please!

- We added documentation for rotating important secrets such as the cookie and
  session secrets.

- We removed the need for reverse proxies by adding the ability to change the
  ORY Kratos Session Cookie domain and path! The
  [kratos-selfservice-ui-node](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-node)
  reference implementation no longer requires HTTP Request piping which greatly
  simplifies the network layout and codebase!

- The ORY Kratos CLI is now capable of managing identities with an interface
  that works almost like the much loved Docker CLI!

- Admins can now initiate account recovery for identities.

- We even refactored Email verification and account recovery. It is now possible
  to add additional strategies e.g. recovery codes in the future, greatly
  increasing the feature set and security capabilities of future ORY Kratos
  versions!

- Lookup to 'Have I Been Pwnd' is no longer a hard requirement, allowing
  registration processes to complete when the service is unavailable or the
  network is slow.

- We contributed several issues and features in upstream projects such as
  justinas/nosurf, gobuffalo/pop, and many more!

- We upgraded the automation and build pipeline to support cross-compilation of
  CGO with Go 1.15+.

- Fetching flows no longer requires CSRF cookies to be set, improving the
  developer experience while not compromising security!

- ORY Kratos now has ORY Kratos Session Cookies that set in the HTTP Cookie
  header, and ORY Kratos Session Tokens that are set as a HTTP Bearer
  Authorization token or the `X-Session-Token` HTTP Header.

Additionally we just exterminated tons of bugs, added tests, improved
documentation, and much much more. Please note that the cost of all this
innovation and collaboration is breaking changes. The details for the individual
breaking changes is the changelog below.
