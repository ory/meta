The ORY team and community is very proud to present the next ORY Kratos iteration!

ORY Kratos is now capable of handling native (iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, ...) login, registration, settings, recovery, and verification flows. As a goodie on top, we released a reference React Native application which you can find on [GitHub](http://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native).

We co-released our reference React Native application which acts as a reference on implementing these flows:

In total, almost 1200 files were changed in about 480 commits. While you can find a list of all changes in the changelist below, these are the changes we are most proud of:

- We renamed login, registration, ... requests to "flows" consistently across the code base, APIs, and data storage. We now:
  - Initiate a login, registration, ... flow;
  - Fetch a login, registration, ... flow; and
  - Complete a login, registration, ... flow using a login flow method such as "Log in with username and password".
- All self-service flows are now capable of handling API-based requests that do not originate from Browser such as Chrome. This is set groundwork for handling native flows (see above)!
- The self service documentation has been refactored and simplified. We added code samples, screenshots, payloads, and curl commands to make things easier and clearer to understand. Video guides have also been added to help you and the community get things done faster!
- Documentation for rotating important secrets such as the cookie and session secrets was added.
- The need for reverse proxies was removed by adding the ability to change the ORY Kratos Session Cookie domain and path! The [kratos-selfservice-ui-node](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-node) reference implementation no longer requires HTTP Request piping which greatly simplifies the network layout and codebase!
- The ORY Kratos CLI is now capable of managing identities with an interface that works almost like the Docker CLI we all love!
- Admins are now able to initiate account recovery for identities.
- Email verification and account recovery were refactored. It is now possible to add additional strategies (e.g. recovery codes) in the future, greatly increasing the feature set and security capabilities of future ORY Kratos versions!
- Lookup to Have I Been Pwnd is no longer a hard requirement, allowing registration processes to complete when the service is unavailable or the network is slow.
- We contributed several issues and features in upstream projects such as justinas/nosurf, gobuffalo/pop, and many more!
- The build pipeline has been upgraded to support cross-compilation of CGO with Go 1.15+.
- Fetching flows no longer requires CSRF cookies to be set, improving developer experience while not compromising on security!
- ORY Kratos now has ORY Kratos Session Cookies (set in the HTTP Cookie header) and ORY Kratos Session Tokens (set as a HTTP Bearer Authorization token or the `X-Session-Token` HTTP Header).

Additionally tons of bugs were fixed, tests added, documentation improved, and much more. Please note that several things have changed in a breaking fashion. You can find details for the individual breaking changes in the changelog below.
