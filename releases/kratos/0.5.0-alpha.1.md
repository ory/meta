Live long and prosper!

The ORY team and the fabulous ORY Community is proud to present the next ORY Kratos iteration!

ORY Kratos is now capable of handling native iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS login, registration, settings, recovery, and
verification flows. And there is a reference React Native application that you can find on
[GitHub](http://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native).

We co-released our reference React Native application which acts as a reference on implementing these flows:

In total, almost 1200 files were changed in about 480 commits. WOW! While you can find a list of all changes in the changelist
below, the following are the features we are proud of:

- We renamed login, registration, ... requests to "flows" consistently across the code base, APIs, and data storage:

  - Initiate a login, registration, ... flow;
  - Fetch a login, registration, ... flow; and
  - Complete a login, registration, ... flow using a login flow method such as "Log in with username and password".

- All self-service flows are now capable of handling API-based requests that do not originate from browsers such as Chrome. This
  is set groundwork for handling native flows named above!

- The self service documentation has been refactored and simplified. We added code samples, screenshots, payloads, and curl
  commands to make things easier and clearer to understand. There are new video guides to help the community get things done
  faster! Just slam that like button please!

- We added documentation for rotating important secrets such as the cookie and session secrets.

- We removed the need for reverse proxies by adding the ability to change the ORY Kratos Session Cookie domain and path! The
  [kratos-selfservice-ui-node](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-node) reference implementation no longer requires HTTP
  Request piping which greatly simplifies the network layout and codebase!

- The ORY Kratos CLI is now capable of managing identities with an interface that works almost like the much loved Docker CLI!

- Admins can now initiate account recovery for identities.

- We even refactored Email verification and account recovery. It is now possible to add additional strategies e.g. recovery codes
  in the future, greatly increasing the feature set and security capabilities of future ORY Kratos versions!

- Lookup to 'Have I Been Pwnd' is no longer a hard requirement, allowing registration processes to complete when the service is
  unavailable or the network is slow.

- We contributed several issues and features in upstream projects such as justinas/nosurf, gobuffalo/pop, and many more!

- We upgraded the automation and build pipeline to support cross-compilation of CGO with Go 1.15+.

- Fetching flows no longer requires CSRF cookies to be set, improving the developer experience while not compromising security!

- ORY Kratos now has ORY Kratos Session Cookies that set in the HTTP Cookie header, and ORY Kratos Session Tokens that are set as
  a HTTP Bearer Authorization token or the `X-Session-Token` HTTP Header.

Additionally we just exterminated tons of bugs, added tests, improved documentation, and much much more. Please note that the cost
of all this innovation and collaboration is breaking changes. The details for the individual breaking changes is the changelog
below.
