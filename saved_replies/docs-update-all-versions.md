Thank you very much for your contribution to the documentation! Due to the way [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) versioning works, you need to make the changes in two locations:

- `docs/versioned_docs/version-v{version}/path/to/file`
- `docs/docs/path/to/file`

Without making them in both locations, the changes will most likely be lost when releasing another version. Thank you! :)
